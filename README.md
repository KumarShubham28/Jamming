Ran into a bunch of bugs but I can't seem to solve this one. 
"TypeError: _this._bind is not a function"
Components/App/App.js:16
> 16 |  this._bind('updatePlaylistName', 'addTrack', 'removeTrack', 'savePlaylist', 'search');

  I'll update the project if I find a solution. Also I left some comments in my code with some things that I don't fully understand yet. Had some help with the project, which is why I don't understand all of my code. Thank you!
